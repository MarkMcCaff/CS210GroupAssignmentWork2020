General notes on completing stage 6:
-Array holding command history would be declared in main function, where the contents from the file will be loaded immediately after, before the main loop starts.
-Save function should be done at very end of main function, so we do not redundantly write code on saving list content more than once.
-File should be saved in format similar to below, having 20 lines:
	1. First command
	2. Second command
	etc.

Function to load file contents (returns array of commands):
	Set file as ".hist_list" file
	Set maximum size of file
	Set file pointer to opening file in read mode
	If file not detected:
		Return null
	While file pointer is not null when reading file contents:
		Read past number at line
		Save text remaining in line of text to command history
		Move to next line
	Close file pointer
	return command history

Function to save file contents (returns integer, parameter: array of commands):
	Set file pointer to text file in write mode
	If file pointer is NULL:
		Present error message
		return -1
	Set index as 0
	While command history contents still to be written:
		Increment index
		Add to file: <index>. <Next command history item>
	Set j as index
	While j is less than 20:
		Increment j
		Add to file: <j>.
	Close file pointer
	Return index
