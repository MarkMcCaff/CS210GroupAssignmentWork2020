Notes:
- Each token should be printed on a single line and maybe enclosed by quotations or something similar
- No seg faults should happen on termination
- Specification says we should assume a maximum character length for reading lines i.e 512 characters

A few test ideas:
1. Type a word into a single line
2. Type a sentence into a single line
3. Type a sentence using only uppercase
4. Type a mixture of lowercase and uppercase characters
5. Type in a typical 'keyboard smash' and see how the shell does with it
6. Just hit '<enter>' (no token input)
7. Hit only '<enter>' over a few lines
8. Go over the character limit
9. Once the shell has dealt with that, go over the character limit again
10. Use only special characters on an input
11. Mix special characters and ordinary words into a line
12. Type 'exit' on its own
13. Type 'exit' a few times
14. Try '<ctrl>-D' on its own
15. Try typing both 'exit' and '<ctrl>-D' on the same line
16. Try typing 'exit' at the end of a string input
17. Try '<ctrl>-D' at the end of a string input
